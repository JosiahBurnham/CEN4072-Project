# CEN4072-Project

The Hertz Self-Service Portal is a way for Hertz employees to deploy AWS services in a user-friendly, non-technical way. Each form is similar, but has different inputs. So we used selenium and the unittest library in Python to test the inputs of each of the forms. Below you can see a model for how the testing suite runs. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62119663/232899562-8850b697-ab0b-4af1-a291-00d4a6110d10.png)
